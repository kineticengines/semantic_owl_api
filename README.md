# SEMANTIC OWL API

Semantic Owl API is a [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) reimplementation of [the original Java implementation](https://github.com/owlcs/owlapi)

Why implement in Rust?

1 - A great number of semantic tools are implemented in Java hence limit those of us who are strongly inclined in Languages like
Rust

2 - Need for a super performant tool which is not limited by the JVM memory constraints

3 - [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) is awesome

## Base derivation

Semantic Owl API id derived from [Owlapi](https://github.com/owlcs/owlapi) version 5.1.17 onwards
